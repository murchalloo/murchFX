# murchFX
Here will be stored my shaders for Reshade. They are mainly desighed for using in virtual photography.

## DoubleExposure.fx
My first shader is made for, obviously, getting double exposures. There is a few types of blending sliders like Weight (how much first exposure affects the second one from 0 to 1) and Gamma (gamma curve affecting both first and second exposures to get a better blending between brighter areas of it). I hope someone find it useful.
